## DSA self paced structured

- This repo would be a 2 month challenge to practice 160-200 questions and preferable coding languages are Java and Golang.
- We also try to maintain each logic thoroughly, so when we come back to revise it would be easy for us to understand the concept.
- We will divide the each question section into 9 parts like how we problem, time taken, pattern, brute force approach, optimal approach, time complexity, space complexity and at last some helpful links. So, it would be again easy for us to get on track and follow up with good approach!
- Do concentrate more on creating test cases also.

## Trees

- Common patterns - Swapping nodes, DFS, BFS
- Common Data structures - Stacks and Queues

| Problem     | Brute force              | Optimal                 | TC (reasons)                   | SC (reasons)                 | Helpful links           |

| Invert tree | Recursive DFS + Swapping | BFS with stack & queues | BF(TC) => O(n)/ BF(TC) => O(n) | O(SC) => O(h)/ O(SC) => O(n) | link[shorturl.at/cHKS4] |
